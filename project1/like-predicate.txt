For advance search part we used simple query "LIKE % %" after the field we want to find. It will solve the problem of pattern that start with or end with. Then we usually can get the result we want.
For title browse part we used like " %" after it. since we want to find the movie start with the letter that accept all of pattern if they have same capital letter.
